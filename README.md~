# A Kernel Seedling

When insmoded into kernel the program loops through current running processes and prints the number
to /proc/count

## Building

inputting "$make" will build the module through the Makefile

## Running

input "$sudo insmod proc_count.ko" to insert the module into the kernel

## Cleaning Up

input "$sudo rmmod proc_count" to remove the module from the kernel

## Testing

Report which kernel release version you tested your module on
(hint: use `uname`, check for options with `man uname`).
It should match release numbers as seen on <https://www.kernel.org/>.
