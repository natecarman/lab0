# Hash Hash Hash
This lab is a test of proficiency with locking and making thread-safe programs, by adding thread locks to a
hash table implementation.

## Building
```shell
$make
```

## Running
```shell
$ ./hash-table-tester -t (# of Cores to Run On) -s (# of iterations)
```

## First Implementation
In the `hash_table_v1_add_entry` function, I initialized a static pthread_mutex_t variable "mutex". Then I locked the
mutex before the

This time version 1 is xxx

## Second Implementation
In the `hash_table_v2_add_entry` function, xxx

### Performance
